# INDOOR-POSITIONING-IN-GPS-DENIED-AREAS-USING-ULTRA-WIDE-BAND-TECHNOLOGY
Positioning is the process of determining positions of people, equipment, and other objects. It has recently been an active research area in which much of the research focuses on utilizing existing technologies to address the problem of positionsâ€™ determination. Positioning can be classified into two types, depending on the environment in which the positioning is conducted: outdoor positioning and indoor positioning. Whereas outdoor positioning is performed outside buildings, indoor positioning is performed inside buildings (e.g., houses, hospitals, and malls). Different applications may require different types of positioning technologies that fit their needs and constraints. For example, Global Positioning System (GPS) is a technology that is suitable and efficient for outdoor spaces rather than indoor spaces because satellite radio signals cannot penetrate solid walls and obstacles. Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) determine the position of an object in a physical space continuously and in real-time. In this Project, a research activity aimed at developing an indoor positioning system, where we cannot rely on other positioning methods like GPS due to its unavailability or Cost Factor, is presented.
